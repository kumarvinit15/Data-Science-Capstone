### 1. Description:
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencie are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

Main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.

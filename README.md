### 1. Description:
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencie are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

Main goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. 

### 2. Installation:

Anaconda Python distribution was used to create the jupyter notebook for this project.There were no additional liabraries installed in support of this project.

`The version of the notebook server is: 5.7.4`.

`The version of Python us: Python 3.7.1 (default, Dec 10 2018, 22:54:23) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)]`.

### 3. File Descriptions:

Following files are uploaded in the repository:

1. `DS Capstone.ipynb: Contains all the analysis and modeling of the Boston and Seattle Airbnb datasets`
2. `train.csv` - the training set
3. `test.csv` - the test set
4. `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format

### 6. Licensing,authors and acknowledgement:

This dataset was created by the company figure-eight and originally shared on their ‘Data For Everyone’ website.
Kaggle hosted a challenge to develop machine learning models to classify tweets into real disaster or not.
